### Bio
Hello! My name is Y3550R (Real name is Kyle). I'm 19 years old and currently studying Computer Engineering in my second year. During my free time, I self-study Cybersecurity using different sites such as Tryhackme.com and OverTheWire.org. I plan on working in the Cybersecurity field, specifically becoming a Security Pentester. I'm also specialized in coding using programming languages such as Python, Java, Lua, Bash, and many more. With that, I created a few video games on Roblox in my spare time as an artistic outlet. Another hobby of mine is experimenting with different computer operating systems. While my work PC runs Windows, I often distro hop between different Linux operating systems on my other PC. I currently use Windows 11 and EndeavourOS Linux.
